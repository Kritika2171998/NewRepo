Grant Gustin as Barry Allen / The Flash: 
A Central City assistant police forensic investigator. Moments after an explosion at the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator, Barry is struck by lightning in his laboratory and doused by chemicals affected by the accident. When he awakens from a nine-month coma, he has superhuman speed.[8] In September 2013, Grant Gustin was cast in the titular role.[8] Andy Mientus, who would eventually be cast as Hartley Rathaway, also auditioned for the role.[9] Gustin began researching the character during the audition process, and reading as many comics as possible. Gustin primarily focused on The New 52 series of comics, because he knew it would be difficult to read everything and he felt the New 52 was the closest to the show's "look and feel".[10]
Candice Patton as Iris West: The daughter of Joe West, sister to Wally West, and Barry Allen's wife, getting engaged in "Duet" and marrying during the Crisis on Earth-X event.[11] She works at Central City Picture News as a journalist.[12]

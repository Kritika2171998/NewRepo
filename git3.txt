On June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion, and the deal closed on Oct.
 26, 2018.[27] GitHub will continue to operate independently as a community, platform and business.
 Under Microsoft, the service will be led by Xamarin's Nat Friedman, reporting to Scott Guthrie, 
executive vice president of Microsoft Cloud and AI. Current CEO Chris Wanstrath will be retained as a 
"technical fellow", also reporting to Guthrie. Microsoft had become a significant user of GitHub, using it to host 
open source projects and development tools such as Chakra Core, PowerShell, and Visual Studio Code, and has backed other
 open source projects such as Linux, and developed Git Virtual File System—a Git extension for managing large-scale
 repositories (and itself has been adopted by GitHub).

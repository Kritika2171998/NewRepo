The sole survivor of the crash was four-year-old Cecelia Cichan of Tempe, Arizona.[6] Romulus firemen found her still belted in her seat, which was faced down, covered in blood and soot. She was found several feet from the bodies of her mother, Paula Cichan, her father Michael and her six-year-old brother David.[7] Cecelia sustained severe burns and fractures to her skull, collarbone, and left leg. She arrived at the hospital initially in critical condition, but later managed to make a full recovery.[8] After the crash, Cecelia lived with her maternal aunt and uncle in Birmingham, Alabama. She spoke to the media about her experience for the first time in 2011.[9][10]

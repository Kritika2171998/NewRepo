Organizational structure
GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers;
 in other words, "everyone is a manager" (self-management).[38] Employees can choose to 
work on projects that interest them (open allocation). However, salaries are set by the chief executive.[39][needs update]

In 2014, GitHub, Inc. introduced a layer of middle management.

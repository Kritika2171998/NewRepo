GitHub
Development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007.[55][56][57] The site was launched in April
 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been made available 
for a few months prior as a beta release.[58]

Projects on GitHub can be accessed and manipulated using the standard Git command-line interface and all 
of the standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows registered and non-registered users to browse 
public repositories on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git plugins have also been created by GitHub and 
other third parties that integrate with the platform.

The site provides social networking-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using wiki software 
called Gollum) and a social network graph to display how developers work on their versions ("forks") of a 
repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.

A user must create an account in order to contribute content to the site, but public repositories can be 
browsed and downloaded by anyone. With a registered user account, users are able to have discussions, manage 
repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and review changes to code.

The fundamental software that underpins GitHub is Git itself, written by Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux. 
The additional software that provides the GitHub user interface was written using Ruby on Rails and Erlang by 
GitHub, Inc. developers Wanstrath,[59] Hyett, and Preston-Werner.

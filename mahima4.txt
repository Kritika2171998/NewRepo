Flight 255 made its takeoff roll on Detroit's runway 3C at approximately 20:44, with Maus at the controls.[1]:3 The plane lifted off the runway at 170 knots (195 mph, 315 km/h), and began to roll from side to side[1]:4 just under 50 feet (15 m) above the ground.[citation needed] The MD-82's rate of climb was greatly reduced as a result of the flaps not being extended,[1]:67 and approximately 2,760 feet (840 m) past the end of runway 3C, the plane's left wing struck a light pole in an airport rental car lot.[1]:22 The impact caused the left wing to start disintegrating and catch fire.[1]:22,26 The plane rolled 90 degrees to the left, striking the roof of an Avis Car Rental building. The plane (now uncontrolled) crashed inverted onto Middlebelt Road and struck vehicles just north of its intersection with Wick Road, killing two people on the ground in an automobile. It then broke apart, with the fuselage skidding across the road, disintegrating and bursting into flames as it hit a railroad overpass and the overpass of eastbound Interstate 94
